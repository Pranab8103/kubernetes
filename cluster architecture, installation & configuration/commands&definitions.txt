Overview of kubeadm
-------------------
* kubeadm allows us to quickly provision a secure kubernetes cluster

Creating infrastructure for k8s from scratch
--------------------------------------------
Common pattern 1 - certificates
-------------------------------
* Generating a set of certificates and keys for each component as part of the cluster for secure communication

Common pattern 2 - Kubeconfig
-----------------------------
* Multiple component needs to interact with api server 
* For this, we will have to create kubeconfig file for individual component

Common pattern 3 - configuration for components
-----------------------------------------------
* Each component of a cluster will have a unique set of configuration options that controls the functionality

Common pattern 4 - Systemd File 
-------------------------------
* We will also create a systemd unit configuration file thta encodes information about a process controlled and 
supervised by systemd

Systemd also can ensure to start the component automatically when system reboots
